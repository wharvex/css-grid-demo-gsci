# Accessibility Prompt: Responsive Layout

## Attachments

Expect a single HTML file and a single CSS file. If these are not provided, ask for them.

## Instructions

I need this page to reflow and still provide a good user experience after zooming in to 400%.

At 400% zoom, the page needs to be organized in a single column layout, with the sidebar collapsed into a hamburger menu. The main content should be easily readable and navigable without horizontal scrolling.

However, I also need to fully understand the changes that are made to make this happen.

Please make the LEAST amount of changes possible to the HTML and CSS to achieve this goal. Please also add comments above each change to clearly explain what exactly the change does and how it works. Define any technical terms that you use in the comments in a way that a non-technical person can understand.
