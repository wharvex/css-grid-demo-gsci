# Accessibility Prompt: Responsive Layout

## Attachments

Expect a single HTML file and a single CSS file. If these are not provided, ask for them.

## Task

Allow this page to responsively "reflow" and still provide a good user experience as the user zooms in.

### Task Guidelines

The user should never need to horizontally scroll to view any of the page content.

Line-wrapping should be implemented at all zoom levels.

At 300% zoom, the page needs to switch to a single column layout, with the sidebar collapsed into a hamburger menu.

When implementing the hamburger menu, ensure it does not overlap any other sections when it is expanded.

DO NOT make any changes that are unrelated to your task.

### Style Guidelines

Make your code changes as understandable and succinct as possible.

Add comments above each change to clearly explain what exactly the change does and how it works.

Define any technical terms that you use in the comments in a way that a non-technical person can understand.
