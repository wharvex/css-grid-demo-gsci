# Accessibility Prompt: Responsive Layout

## Attachments

Expect a single HTML file and a single CSS file. If these are not provided, ask for them.

## Instructions

I need this page to reflow and still provide a good user experience after zooming in to 400%.

However, I also need to fully understand the changes that are made to make this happen.

Please make the least amount of changes possible to the HTML and CSS to achieve this goal, and clearly explain what exactly the changes do and how they work.

Do not assume I know very much at all about CSS or HTML or JavaScript.
